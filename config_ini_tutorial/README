This is a tutorial to generate a config.ini file.

Config files are important for: 
    (1) Creating reproducible data analyses
        by recording all paths, scripts, source code, 
        and files used to run a pipeline.
    
    (2) Modifying pipeline inputs in an organized fashion
    
    (3) Modifying data analyses when reviewers want to see 
        data processed in a different way. 
    

In the tutorial, we will:
(1) learn to write/read a config file 
(2) use portions of the config file as inputs for: 
    (2a) a driver script (aka a PIPELINE) to  LD-expand significant GWAS variants
    (2b) an auxiliary script that filters for significant GWAS hits
    (2c) an auxiliary script that LD expands significant GWAS hits
